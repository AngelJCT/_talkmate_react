# TalkMate

## An AI assistant chatbot to help you learn a new language. By adopting a persona tailored to the chosen language, the chatbot ensures fluidity and relevance throughout the dialogue. It goes beyond mere language mechanics, offering translation, pronunciation guidance, and insightful cultural tips that foster a more profound understanding of the language's native community and traditions.

#### This project is part of my learning journey of JavaScript and React. This web application was made with React, Tailwindcss and OpenAI API chat completion endpoint. It's responsive and more suited for mobile use.

## Actual features:
#### - Only support Japanese language at the moment.
#### - You can save chats in localStorage.
#### - Clickable glass cards that to start a conversation.
